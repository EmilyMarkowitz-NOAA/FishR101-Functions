# Task 2------------------------------------------

# Here is a function that we are going to improve on: 

priceCalculator <- function(hours, pph=40){
  net.price <- hours * pph
  round(net.price)
}
# Here’s what this code does:
# Everything between the braces is the body of the function (see Chapter 8).
# Between the parentheses, you specify the arguments hours (without a default value) 
#    and pph (with a default value of $40 per hour).
# You calculate the net price by multiplying hours by pph.
# The outcome of the last statement in the body of your function is the returned value. 
#    In this case, this is the total price rounded to the dollar.

# You could drop the argument pph and just multiply hours by 40. But that would 
# mean that if, for example, your colleague uses a different hourly rate, they 
# would have to change the value in the body of the function in order to be able 
# to use it. It’s good coding practice to use arguments with default values for 
# any value that can change. Doing so makes a function more flexible and usable.

# Now imagine you have some big clients that give you a lot of work. 
# To keep them happy, you decide to give them a reduction of 10 percent on the 
# price per hour for orders that involve more than 100 hours of work. So, if 
# the number of hours worked is larger than 100, you calculate the new price 
# by multiplying the price by 0.9.

# You can write that almost literally in your code like this:
  
  priceCalculator <- function(hours, pph=40){
    net.price <- hours * pph
    if(hours > 100) {
      net.price <- net.price * 0.9
    }
    round(net.price)
  }
  
# You can see that the reduction is given only when the number of hours is larger than 100:
priceCalculator(hours = 55)
priceCalculator(hours = 110)

# Alternatively: 
# This construct is the most general way you can specify an if statement. 
# But if you have only one short line of code in the code block, you don’t 
# have to put braces around it. You can change the complete if statement in the 
# function with the following line:

priceCalculator <- function(hours, pph=40){
  net.price <- hours * pph
  if(hours > 100) net.price <- net.price * 0.9
  round(net.price)
}

priceCalculator(hours = 55)
priceCalculator(hours = 110)
