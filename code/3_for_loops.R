# What is a for loop? ---------------------------------

# = “looping”, “cycling”, “iterating” or just replicating instructions. 

# Loops help automate multi-step processes by organizing sequences of actions 
# and by grouping the parts that need to be repeated (blocks of instructions). 

# for loops are best shown with examples:

# Example 1 (EASY)---------------------------------

# Create a simple loop that will do this same task in THREE lines or less

print(paste("The year is", 2010))
print(paste("The year is", 2011))
print(paste("The year is", 2012))
print(paste("Te year is", 2013)) # Typo?! NOOOO
print(paste("The year is", 2014))
print(paste("The year is", 2015))

# Simple! We are going to use what we just learned about loops to iterate between years!
# There are two ways of writing this loop:

#A. 
#      Here, we use the iterative value i to cycle through the items in the yrs vector. 
#      Such that i will equal 1, 2, 3,... length(yrs) (=6) and we find the ith 
#      item in the yrs vector by calling yrs[i]. 
yrs<-c(2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015) # create a variable

for (i in 1:length(yrs)){             # Define iterations - where i = 1,2,3,... and we call the ith item of the vector yrs
  print(paste("The year is", yrs[i])) # The body of the for loop
}                                     # DONE

i # this is a level
mode(i)
class(i)

# B. 
#      Here, we use the variables to be the iterative value, such that 
#      year will be 2010 in the first loop, 2011 the second loop,... 
#      and 2015 for the last loop. 
for (yr in c(2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015)){ # Define iterations - Where yr = 2010, 2011, etc. iteratively
  print(paste("The year is", yr))             # The body of the for loop
}                                             # DONE

yr # not a level, the actual number!
mode(yr)
class(yr)

# This was clearly a simple example, but you can see where this approach would 
# become really important for when something has to be done a bunch of times and 
# for more complicated statements

# A note for later, printing i can be a useful tool for troubleshooting code so 
# you can see where a loop breaks. 

# Example 2 (HARD) ---------------------------------

# Lets say that we want to look at this data by year and by stratum to find out 
# what the top 5 species are in each 

# Initial data wrangling
EBS_summary<-EBS_haul_table %>% # use EBS data to create object "EBS_summary"
  dplyr::group_by(YEAR, STRATUM, COMMON) %>% # Group by YEAR, STRATUM, COMMON for next command
  dplyr::summarise(WTCPUE_sum = sum(WTCPUE, na.rm = TRUE)) # sum WTCPUE across grouped items above

EBS_summary

# ***Task 2 - the long way ---------------------------------

# Year = 2016, Stratum = 10 
max_5_spp_2016_10 <- EBS_summary %>%
  dplyr::filter(YEAR == 2016, STRATUM == 10) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(-WTCPUE_sum) %>%
  dplyr::top_n(n = 5)

max_5_spp_2016_10

# Year = 2016, Stratum = 20 
max_5_spp_2016_20 <- EBS_summary %>% # Change name
  dplyr::filter(YEAR == 2016, STRATUM == 20) %>% # we change these variables
  dplyr::arrange(-WTCPUE_sum) %>%
  dplyr::top_n(n = 5)

max_5_spp_2016_20

# ...you get the idea... that this will take FOREVER.
# ...and yes, THERE IS A BETTER WAY!

# ******Example 2 - with for loops (MORE COMPLICATED)------------------
###### ***Task 2  ---------------------------------

# Here are all of the instances we need checked
unique_yr_strat<-EBS_summary %>% 
  dplyr::select("YEAR", "STRATUM") %>% 
  distinct()

unique_yr_strat

max_5_spp<-NULL

for (i in 1:nrow(unique_yr_strat)){
  
  # basically use the same code you had above, but with iterative, not fixed, 
  # variables for year and stratum 
  # max_5_spp0 <- NULL
  max_5_spp0 <- EBS_summary %>%
    dplyr::filter(YEAR == unique_yr_strat$YEAR[i], 
                  STRATUM == unique_yr_strat$STRATUM[i]) %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(-WTCPUE_sum) %>%
    dplyr::top_n(n = 5)
  
  max_5_spp<-bind_rows(max_5_spp, 
                       max_5_spp0)
}

max_5_spp # And that was so easy, so much shorter to write, and faster!!

# While we are here, let's check out the other objects that were created in our 
# loop that we don't care about that came out of this: 

# What is i? By printing it here, it will just print the number of the last iteration
i
# but by looking in our environment under values, we see that i = 36L
#  to learn more about i, we can employ class() and mode()
class(i) # an integer is a value with no decimals
mode(i) # integers are numeric
# i is a numeric integer (no decimal places/only whole numbers)

# and what is max_5_spp0? 
max_5_spp0
# Just the last 5 species that were caught from the last year and stratum assessed
# We don't actually need max_5_spp0 for anything after this point, but it is saved in our environment
# (remember this when we talk about functions in a bit!)

#### Think, how can this same example be done without a for loop (using tidyverse!)?
